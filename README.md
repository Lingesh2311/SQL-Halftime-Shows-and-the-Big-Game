# SQL-Halftime-Shows-and-the-Big-Game


This dataset contains the python notebook for the tabular data which contains the perfomances, artists, and games for the Superbowl from 2000 until 2018. The notebook follows analysis on the datasets using SQL in python using the magic function `%%sql`. Some common questions that are seen include:

* What are the most extreme game outcomes?
* How does the game affect the television viewership?
* How has viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
* Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?


## BASIC CONCEPTS INVOLVED:
Joining data in SQL, Using SQL in Jupyter


## More about the database:
The database it is stored in is made up of three tables, one with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_champions] (game data), one with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_television_ratings] (TV broadcast data), and one with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_halftime_shows] (halftime musician performance data) for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018.
